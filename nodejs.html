                <p>Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a web browser, enabling server-side development. It's an open-source, cross-platform tool known for its scalability and efficiency, especially in handling I/O-intensive tasks. Node.js is built on Google Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine and uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, allowing it to handle numerous concurrent connections efficiently. </p>
