                <p>Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language and computing platform first released by Sun Microsystems in 1995. It's designed to be portable, meaning Java code can run on different operating systems without needing to be rewritten, thanks to the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Java is widely used for developing a variety of applications, including web, mobile, enterprise, and big data solutions. </p>
